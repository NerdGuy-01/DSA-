/*
Problem Statement: Given an array Arr[] of integers, rearrange the numbers of the given array into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange to the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

permutations must be in order like 123<132<213<231<312<321 its called lexographical order 

Brute : Generate all possible recursions then linear search and print next index of it
