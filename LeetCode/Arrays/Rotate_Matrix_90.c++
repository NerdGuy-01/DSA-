/*
Problem Statement: Given a matrix, your task is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise. Means transpose of matrix

Brute :
Take another dummy matrix of n*n, and then take the first row of the matrix and put it in the last column of the dummy matrix, take the second row of the matrix, and put it in the second last column of the matrix and so.
Time Complexity: O(N*N) to linearly iterate and put it into some other matrix.

Space Complexity: O(N*N) to copy it into some other matrix


Optimal :
 By observation, we see that the first column of the original matrix is the reverse of the first row of the rotated matrix, so thatâ€™s why we transpose the matrix and then reverse each row, and since we are making changes in the matrix itself space complexity gets reduced to O(1).

// Brute 
vector < vector < int >> rotate(vector < vector < int >> & matrix) {
    int n = matrix.size();
    vector < vector < int >> rotated(n, vector < int > (n, 0)); // creates a new array rotated filled with zeros
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        rotated[j][n - i - 1] = matrix[i][j];
    }
    }
    return rotated;
}

// optimal 
void rotate(vector < vector < int >> & matrix) {
    int n = matrix.size();
    //transposing the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) { // this makes sure to swap only below the diagonal once 
        swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
    }
    }
    //reversing each row of the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    reverse(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
    }
}
