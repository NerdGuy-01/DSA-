/*
Problem Statement: Given a row-wise sorted matrix of size MXN, where M is no. of rows and N is no. of columns, find the median in the given matrix.

Note: MXN is odd.

odd * odd = odd

Brute :
Time Complexity: O(MXN) + O(MXN(log(MXN))), where M = number of row in the given matrix, N = number of columns in the given matrix

Reason: At first, we are traversing the matrix to copy the elements. This takes O(MXN) time complexity. Then we are sorting the linear array of size (MXN), that takes O(MXN(log(MXN))) time complexity

Space Complexity: O(MXN) as we are using a temporary list to store the elements of the matrix.

Optimal :
using binary search 
Time Complexity: O(log(109)) X O(M(logN)), where M = number of rows in the given matrix, N = number of columns in the given matrix

Reason: Our search space lies between [0, 109] as the min(matrix) can be 0 and the max(matrix) can be 109. We are applying binary search in this search space and it takes O(log(109)) time complexity. Then we call countSmallEqual() function for every ‘mid’ and this function takes O(M(logN)) time complexity.

Space Complexity : O(1) as we are not using any extra space
